# PWATextEditor

## Description

This Text Editor was created in an exercise in Progressive Web Apps (PWA's). As such, the app can be installed and be used without an internet connection,
with data being saved whenever a user clicks out of the window. The Code its self was rather simple, with most of the difficulty being learning the syntax
for the various node modules imported into the project.

## Installation

To install the PWA, simply click the install button and allow the app to install when the prompt appears.

## Usage

To utilize the app, simply type whatever you desire and whenever clicking outside of the app, the text will be saved. Close and reopen the website, and 
the text will still be there.
